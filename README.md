# KotlinCS308

<h1>History of Kotlin</h1>
The name of the language is Kotlin, it was developed by JetBrains in 2010 and released in July 2011 with the name Project Kotlin for the Java Virtual Machine. However, the first stable version of Kotlin was officially released on 15 February 2016.
It was written because they needed a language that was concise, elegant, expressive, and interoperable with Java. The language was also aimed to have a reduction in the amount of boilerplate code required, introduction of new tooling supports and constructors, with a high concentration on safety and clarity.
Initially, Kotlin was first used as a language for Android development, however, it quickly spreads through the Java community because of its features and has since been used for many types of applications like Back-end web development, Full-stack web development, Data Science, and multi-platform mobile development.
The main resources that relate to the language that I will use to learn are listed at the end of the file.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
In order to install the language, I had to visit the URL: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html to find a suitable environment. It is recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, and I chose IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE for this course.
To run a program on Kotlin, open a new project in the IDE, then add a new code file in the project with the extension “.kt” at the end of its name. The codes then are run by pressing “Ctrl+Shift+F10” or press the green button at the left of the code.
For the comments, the inline (single line) is denoted by the characters “//”. The multi-line comment is denoted with the pair "/*" and "*/". When the user press “/*” and press Enter, the closing marks are automatically generated.
